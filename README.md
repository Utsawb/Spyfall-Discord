# Spyfall-Discord
Simple spyfall bot written in with the Discord.py wrapper
My first time creating a bot that can handle multiple instances at once
Not the most efficent, since I'm using dictinaries as my sessions trackers, but it works

If you want to use this bot, you must create your own Discord Application on the developer portal within the discord website. Once you create a bot within the client, copy and paste the token into the token variable inside Spyfall.py. Make sure to have Dicord.py installed.
